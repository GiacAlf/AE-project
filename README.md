# AE-project

This is an algorithm engineering project about edge connectivity problem in graph theory implemented with Python.
They have been implemented two algorithms, Ford-Fulkerson and Edmonds-Karp compared to NextwokX 
edge connectivity build-in function.
There are the results of the comparison but not the graph themselves because of space limitation; 
they can be recreated with the graph generator script.
